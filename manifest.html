						<b>1. Fuck rights and wrongs. </b>There is no objectively correct way of doing things.
						<br>
						<br>
						An objective opinion is one not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts. People are shaped by a number of events and experiences, forming a unique combination that is specific for each person.
						<br>
						<br>
						One's knowledge is the result of the exploration of the surrounding world and is the reflection of one's analysis. Think of dozens of various outcomes based on a single brief, where each designer responds according to the experiences they've gone through.
						<br>
						<br>Remember that each problem holds thousands of solutions, and there are no wrong answers. Thus, liberate yourself from the fear of doing the wrong thing. Bruce Mau (Incomplete Manifesto) tells us that the wrong answer is the right answer in search of a different question. His advice: Ask different questions.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> 2. Stop looking back for approval.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						This one is for students and for anyone else who needs it. People get manipulated into believing that institutions consist of and are lead by unquestionable authorities.
						Once students get in, they chase that pat on the back from someone they believe holds the right to decide what's good and bad.
						<br>
						<br>
						By acknowledging the fact that the very nature of objectivity is a myth, the weight of the power gets replaced and reveals itself as subjective judgment, thus giving the freedom to accept or disagree with it. By taking away the power of objectivity, the authority becomes nothing but a dummy of dominance with no foundation beneath it. The death of authority is the new "don't make an idol in the form of anything.".
						<br>
						<br>
						Take the advice from those you trust, whose subjective vision you share. Find someone who gets you.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>3. Fuck speaking when spoken to.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The submissiveness and excessive modesty forced upon women from a young age are not fitting for the grotesque of our environment. In our reality, the fight for equality and diversity is still far from being over.
						<br>
						<br>
						Today, when women are less likely to be in leadership positions, when women and POC get paid far less than their male counterparts, where LGBT+ and the gender non-conforming folks rarely get any representation at major design-events, fuck modesty.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>4. Liberate yourself from the fear of failure.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Failures are inevitable, so get over it as soon as you can. Failure leads to growth, so crave failures as you crave success as one is impossible without the other.
						<br>
						<br>
						Be quick to make mistakes, be even quicker to learn from them.<br>
						<br><br>
						</p>		
					<p class="columntwo js--img-active">
						<b>5. Seek critique.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The best ideas emerge in discussions, where different perspectives meet, so let yourself be misunderstood, let yourself explain again, and don’t turn your back on criticism from someone you trust. The value of a well thought out critique is hard to overestimate, as there are a few people who care, and even fewer who are interested in sharing their experience and helping you grow and improve. Thus, appreciate and hold onto the ones that do.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>6. Explore things outside of the standardized definitions.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						A book is a "written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers." Ask yourself, what else can it be? A poster is a large printed picture or notice put up for advertising or decoration (Cambridge Dictionary). But is that all?
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>7. Find beauty in small things, random things.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Pay attention to random things you overlook. Everything is data, which, therefore, can be analyzed and used as a starting point for a project. A fascinating project Dear Data emerged from two designers analyzing ‘everyday things’, such as types of animals they saw in a day, number of times their partners made them angry, reasons and number of times they checked time throughout the day. By realizing that everything is potential material, that can be analyzed and reused, one may find inspiration in areas outside of design and produce richer, and at times, more unexpected work.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>8. Whenever you feel like you know enough dig deeper.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Nothing is or should be considered fixed or permanent, in the world of constant rapid growth, let yourself grow with it. Often one's research is linear, consisting of a starting point and a destination.
						<br>
						<br>Don't hesitate to go off-road, take unexpected turns, go off-topic. The interest lies in the unexpected paths. While working on a project, be open to discovering content that may feed your future ones or shape and transform your current one. Be hungry for side quests.
						<br><br>
						
					</p>

					<p class="columnthree js--img-active">  
						<b>9. Make something every day.</b>
						<br>
						<br> The hypothesis of ten thousand hours of deliberate practice leading to mastery of a certain skill is based on unprecedented arguments and is highly doubtable yet it feeds the idea of having a goal to work towards. Pick something, set a goal, and take a step closer to it every day.
						<br>
						<br>
						It is to be expected, that one gets demotivated if they don't see the result of their work. Oftentimes projects require more research than actual making, in this case, make something, anything, even if it's shitty. At the end of the day, seeing the result of your work is better than seeing nothing at all. Find something that works for you and do it every day. When in doubt, make a poster.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>10. Collaborate.</b>
						<br><br>
						Commit to the cause, let others help you, and be ready to give support in return. The egocentrism is toxic and prevents one from seeing things from a different perspective and believing that others will have their own experience, potentially useful for one's work.
						<br>
						<br>
						Each project that involves two or more people working together is full of tension, conflict, joy, and an enormous capacity for innovation.

						11. Humor is the universal key.
						<br>
						<br>
						12. Don’t take your-
						<br>self too seriously. 	<br>
						Make stuff with no intent. Not everything you make has to be high-class, well-developed, award-worthy. Not everything you make has to be posted online. Create stuff out of boredom and trash it right after you are done. Who cares?
						<br> <br>
						14. Fuck ma-
						<br>ni–
						<br>fes-
						<br>tos!
						Fuck mani-<br>festos’ authors too!
